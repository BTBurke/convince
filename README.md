This is an experimental framework for creating data-driven slide decks using reveal.js and D3.  It's an AngularJS webapp that lets you author slide decks that include D3-generated interactive graphs and charts.

Roadmap:
1.  Basic authoring tools for creating simple slide presentations
2.  Ability to insert D3-generated charts from JSON data sources
3.  Presentation mode with D3-chart interactivity
4.  Server-backed API for simultaneous editing by multiple users
5.  API for retreiving live JSON data and updating chart in real-time
6.  Ability to fork presentations
7.  Review/commenting workflow
8.  Interactive presentation mode allows audience to follow along and markup slides during the presentation (using websockets)
9.  Metrics for evaluating how users view and interact with the material
