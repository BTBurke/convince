This is an experimental framework for creating data-driven slide decks using reveal.js and D3.  It's an AngularJS webapp that lets you author slide decks that include D3-generated interactive graphs and charts.

Roadmap:
# Basic authoring tools for creating simple slide presentations
# Ability to insert D3-generated charts from JSON data sources
# Presentation mode with D3-chart interactivity
# Server-backed API for simultaneous editing by multiple users
# API for retreiving live JSON data and updating chart in real-time
# Ability to fork presentations
# Review/commenting workflow
# Interactive presentation mode allows audience to follow along and markup slides during the presentation (using websockets)
# Metrics for evaluating how users view and interact with the material
