Skeleton - Vagrant + Ansible
===

This is another installment in my multi-part series of project skeletons.  This one sets you up for a generic Vagrant + Ansible development environment.  It includes:

* An amazing Vagrantfile that will cue up Anisble for devops goodness
* An Ansible inventory file that works with a stock Vagrant set up
* A vagrant.yaml file that contains the tasks you want to execute on vagrant up

Notes:

1. This is set up for a basic Python project on Ubuntu with a base box name "precise64"
2. It does nifty things like add the /vagrant directory to the PYTHONPATH
